# Provider Directory Code Challenge

Create a basic, web-based contact directory that presents users with a list of available contacts allowing them to add, edit, and delete. For
convenience, users should be able to sort, filter, and search the contacts in the directory. Contacts should contain first name, last name,
email, practice name, and specialty.
